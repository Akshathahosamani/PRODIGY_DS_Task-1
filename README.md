Welcome to my submission for **Task 1** of the Data Science Internship at **Prodigy Infotech**.
In this task, I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the World Bank population dataset, focusing on **creating visualizations** that represent the distribution of categorical and continuous variables.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Data is often hard to interpret in raw numerical form. The task was to:

* Use a dataset (World Bank Population Data)
* Apply **EDA techniques**
* Visualize data distribution using **bar charts** and **histograms**
* Derive meaningful **insights** from population trends

This helps in understanding how populations are distributed across countries and identifying global demographic patterns.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used for this task is from the **World Bank Population Data**:
ðŸ‘‰ [World Population Dataset](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL)

It contains **population records across countries from 2001 to 2022**, making it suitable for demographic and trend analysis.

## ðŸ›  Tools and Libraries Used

* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Python**
* **Pandas & NumPy** â†’ Data cleaning and manipulation
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** â†’ Data visualization

---

## ðŸ”Ž Approach

1. **Data Cleaning**

   * Removed unnecessary columns
   * Handled missing values and duplicates
   * Extracted relevant population data for analysis

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Performed initial exploration to understand dataset structure
   * Checked for outliers and unusual values

3. **Visualization**

   * **Bar Chart** â†’ To show the top 10 most populous countries in 2022
   * **Histogram** â†’ To visualize the distribution of population across all countries

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

* The **bar chart** revealed that a small group of countries (China, India, USA, etc.) account for a major portion of the global population.
* The **histogram** showed that most countries fall into lower population ranges, while very few countries have extremely high populations.
* These visualizations made it easier to interpret population trends and highlight demographic imbalances worldwide.

---

## âœ… Conclusion

* **Bar charts** are effective for comparing population sizes between countries.
* **Histograms** highlight the overall distribution pattern across all nations.
* A clear pattern emerges: **a few countries dominate global population numbers**, while most remain significantly smaller.
* This exercise demonstrates how **data visualization simplifies complex datasets** and provides quick insights for policymakers, researchers, and analysts.
