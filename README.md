ðŸ““ Task-01: Data Visualization with Bar Chart or Histogram

#ðŸ”¹ Objective

The aim of this task is to visualize the distribution of categorical or continuous variables using bar charts and histograms.

Examples:
Distribution of ages in a population

Distribution of genders in a population

Distribution of population across countries

ðŸ”¹ Dataset

We will use the World Bank Population Dataset:
ðŸ‘‰ World Bank Population Data

This dataset contains population data by country and year, useful for demographic analysis.

ðŸ”¹ Workflow in Jupyter Notebook

Load the dataset â†’ Import the World Bank data into Jupyter Notebook.

Preprocess data â†’ Handle missing values, filter necessary columns.

Visualization â†’  Create bar charts for categorical comparisons (e.g., population by country).

   Create histograms for continuous variables (e.g., distribution of population values).
                
Analysis â†’ Interpret patterns, outliers, and trends.

ðŸ”¹ Expected Output

Bar Chart â†’ Top 10 most populous countries in the latest year.

Histogram â†’ Global population distribution across countries.

ðŸ”¹ Tools & Libraries

Jupyter Notebook

Python

Pandas â†’ Data handling

Matplotlib & Seaborn â†’ Data visualization

ðŸ”¹ Conclusion

Bar charts help compare categories (e.g., top populated countries).

Histograms highlight the spread of population values across all countries.

Visual analysis shows that while a few countries (like China and India) dominate global population, most countries have relatively smaller populations.

Such visualizations make demographic insights more intuitive, clear, and actionable.
